# Irwin-Hall Distribution Theory

This module provides the complete theory of the Irwin-Hall distribution and its connection
to the hitting time problem. The Irwin-Hall distribution is the distribution of the sum
of n independent uniform [0,1) random variables.

## Main Results

- `irwin_hall_cdf`: The cumulative distribution function P(S_n ≤ x)
- `irwin_hall_pdf`: The probability density function (piecewise polynomial)
- `simplex_volume_formula`: Volume of the n-simplex equals 1/n!
- `hitting_time_connection`: P(τ > n) = P(S_n < 1) = 1/n!
- `irwin_hall_moments`: Moment generating function and moments

## Interface

This module provides the distributional perspective on the hitting time problem,
showing how it connects to classical results in probability theory about uniform
distributions and geometric probability.
