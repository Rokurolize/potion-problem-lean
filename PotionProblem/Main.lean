# Main Theorem: E[τ] = e

This module contains the main theorem proving that the expected hitting time
for independent uniform [0,1) random variables to sum to at least 1 is exactly e.

## Main Result

- `main_theorem`: E[τ] = e

## Remaining Work

This file contains 2 sorry declarations that represent incomplete mathematical proofs:
1. `summable_hitting_time`: Prove the hitting time series is summable
2. Reindexing proof inside `main_theorem`: Complete the bijection argument
