  -- The series n * hitting_time_pmf n equals:
  -- - 0 for n = 0, 1
  -- - 1/(n-2)! for n ≥ 2
  -- This is essentially the factorial series ∑ 1/k! with two zeros prepended
  
  -- Mathematical proof strategy:
  -- Since n * hitting_time_pmf n = 0 for n < 2 and = 1/(n-2)! for n ≥ 2,
  -- we need to show that ∑' n, (if n < 2 then 0 else 1/(n-2)!) converges
  
  -- This series is essentially ∑' k, 1/k! with two zeros prepended
  -- Since ∑' k, 1/k! converges (to e), our series also converges
  
  -- Formal approach: Use that f(n+2) = 1/n! and summable_inv_factorial
  -- to conclude summability of f
  
  -- We'll show that the function equals a summable shifted factorial series
  -- Key: ∑' n, n * hitting_time_pmf n = ∑' n, f n where
  -- f(n) = 0 for n < 2 and f(n) = 1/(n-2)! for n ≥ 2
  
  -- We can rewrite this as: ∑' n, f n = ∑' n, f (n + 2)
  -- And f(n + 2) = 1/n! for all n

  rw [exp_one_eq_tsum_inv_factorial]
  
  -- The key insight: our sum ∑' n, n * hitting_time_pmf n can be rewritten
  -- as ∑' k, 1/k! by using the relationship f(n+2) = 1/n!
  
  -- We already proved in summable_hitting_time that:
  -- (fun n => n * hitting_time_pmf n) = (fun n => if n < 2 then 0 else 1/(n-2)!)
  -- and this equals ∑' k, 1/k! after shifting indices
  
  -- Use the same approach as in summable_hitting_time:
  -- The series ∑' n, n * hitting_time_pmf n equals the shifted factorial series
  
  -- From our hitting_time_formula and hitting_time_zero lemmas:
  have h_form : ∀ (n : ℕ), n ≥ 2 → (n : ℝ) * hitting_time_pmf n = 1 / (n - 2).factorial :=
    fun n hn => hitting_time_formula n hn
  have h_zero : ∀ (n : ℕ), n < 2 → (n : ℝ) * hitting_time_pmf n = 0 :=
    fun n hn => hitting_time_zero n hn
  
  -- The summability is already established
  have h_summable : Summable (fun n : ℕ => (n : ℝ) * hitting_time_pmf n) := summable_hitting_time
  
  -- We use the fact that our series is exactly the factorial series with 2 zeros prepended
  -- This follows from the same reindexing argument used in summable_hitting_time
  -- Since ∑' n, (n+2) * hitting_time_pmf (n+2) = ∑' n, 1/n! (by hitting_time_formula)
  -- and the first two terms are zero, we get ∑' n, n * hitting_time_pmf n = ∑' n, 1/n!
  
  -- The proof strategy: use the same transformation as summable_hitting_time
  -- but for the tsum equality instead of just summability
  
  sorry -- This follows from the same reindexing argument as summable_hitting_time
