# Main Theorem with Geometric Interpretation

This module extends the main theorem with the geometric interpretation
via the Irwin-Hall distribution. 

**WARNING**: This module imports `IrwinHallTheory` which contains 4 sorries
related to advanced topics:
- B-spline positivity
- Finite difference theory
- Stirling numbers and combinatorial identities
- Piecewise polynomial continuity

The main theorem E[τ] = e remains fully proven without these sorries.
This module simply adds additional geometric insights.
