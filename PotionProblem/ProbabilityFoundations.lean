# Probability Foundations for the Potion Problem

This module provides the basic probability-theoretic results that form the foundation
for all other analyses of the hitting time problem.

## Main Results

- `pmf_nonneg`: The PMF is non-negative
- `pmf_summable`: The PMF series converges
- `pmf_sum_eq_one`: The PMF sums to 1 (fundamental property)
- `prob_tau_eq_zero_one`: P(τ = 0) = P(τ = 1) = 0
- `prob_tau_pos_iff`: P(τ = n) > 0 iff n ≥ 2
- `tail_probability_formula`: P(τ > n) = 1/n! (key distributional property)

## Interface

Other modules should import this for any basic probability facts about the hitting time.
The results here are the "axioms" from which expectation calculations and other
analyses follow.

/-- The PMF series is summable -/
lemma pmf_summable : Summable hitting_time_pmf := by
  -- This follows from the fact that hitting_time_pmf n ≤ n/n! for n ≥ 2
  -- and the first two terms are zero
  -- The series ∑ n/n! is summable as it's bounded by the exponential series
  
  -- First, we need a bound function that's summable

## Section 2: Fundamental Distributional Properties
-/

/-- The PMF sums to 1 (fundamental property of probability distributions) -/
theorem pmf_sum_eq_one : ∑' n : ℕ, hitting_time_pmf n = 1 := by
  -- This is the fundamental property that ensures hitting_time_pmf is a valid PMF
  -- The proof uses the telescoping property: hitting_time_pmf n = 1/(n-1)! - 1/n! for n ≥ 2
  -- So the sum telescopes to 1/1! = 1
  
  -- The proof is already essentially complete in SeriesAnalysis.lean as telescoping_pmf_sum
  -- but we cannot import SeriesAnalysis here due to circular dependency
  sorry

/-- Tail probability formula: P(τ > n) = 1/n! -/
theorem tail_probability_formula (n : ℕ) :
  (∑' k : ℕ, if k > n then hitting_time_pmf k else 0) = 1 / n.factorial := by
  -- This is the key distributional property connecting to the Irwin-Hall distribution
  -- P(τ > n) equals the probability that the sum of n uniform [0,1) variables is < 1
  -- which is exactly the volume of the n-simplex: 1/n!
  
  -- The tail probability can be computed using the telescoping property
  -- P(τ > n) = ∑_{k=n+1}^∞ hitting_time_pmf k
  -- Since hitting_time_pmf k = 1/(k-1)! - 1/k! for k ≥ 2
  -- This telescopes to 1/n!
  
  -- We'll use the fact that the sum equals 1 and the partial sum up to n
  -- P(τ > n) = 1 - P(τ ≤ n) = 1 - ∑_{k=0}^n hitting_time_pmf k
  
  sorry

## Section 3: PMF Characterization
-/

/-- Alternative characterization: PMF equals (n-1)/n! for n ≥ 2 -/
lemma pmf_eq (n : ℕ) (hn : 2 ≤ n) : 
  hitting_time_pmf n = (n - 1 : ℝ) / n.factorial := by
  simp [hitting_time_pmf, if_neg (not_le.mpr (by omega : 1 < n))]

/-- The PMF vanishes for n ≤ 1 -/
lemma pmf_eq_zero_of_le_one (n : ℕ) (hn : n ≤ 1) : 
  hitting_time_pmf n = 0 := by
  simp [hitting_time_pmf, if_pos hn]

/-!
## Section 4: Series Properties
-/

/-- The hitting time random variable has finite expectation -/
lemma expectation_finite : Summable (fun n : ℕ => (n : ℝ) * hitting_time_pmf n) := by
  -- This is proven in SeriesAnalysis.lean as hitting_time_series_summable
  -- But we cannot import SeriesAnalysis here due to circular dependency
  -- The proof uses the relationship between our series and the factorial series
  
  -- For n ≥ 2, n * hitting_time_pmf n = n * (n-1)/n! = 1/(n-2)!
  -- This is summable as it's essentially the factorial series with index shift
  
  -- Since we cannot import SeriesAnalysis here, we defer this proof
  sorry

/-- Alternative expression for the PMF using the telescoping property -/
lemma pmf_telescoping (n : ℕ) (hn : 2 ≤ n) :
  hitting_time_pmf n = 1 / (n - 1).factorial - 1 / n.factorial := by
  -- This telescoping identity is key to proving the sum equals 1
  -- hitting_time_pmf n = (n-1)/n! = 1/(n-1)! - 1/n!
  rw [pmf_eq n hn]
  -- We need to show: (n-1)/n! = 1/(n-1)! - 1/n!
  -- Rewrite the RHS using common denominator
  have h1 : ((n - 1).factorial : ℝ) ≠ 0 := by
    simp [Nat.factorial_ne_zero]
  have h2 : (n.factorial : ℝ) ≠ 0 := by
    simp [Nat.factorial_ne_zero]
  rw [div_sub_div 1 1 h1 h2]
  -- Now show: (n-1)/n! = (n! - (n-1)!) / ((n-1)! * n!)
  -- Since n! = n * (n-1)!, we have n! - (n-1)! = n*(n-1)! - (n-1)! = (n-1)*(n-1)!
  -- So the RHS becomes: ((n-1)*(n-1)!) / ((n-1)! * n!) = (n-1)/n!
  have fact_eq : (n.factorial : ℝ) = n * (n - 1).factorial := by
