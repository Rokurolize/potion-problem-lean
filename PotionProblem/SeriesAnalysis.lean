# Series Analysis for the Potion Problem

This module contains the series convergence and telescoping proofs that form the analytical
foundation for computing the expected hitting time.

## Main Results

- `hitting_time_series_summable`: The expectation series ∑ n · P(τ = n) converges
- `hitting_time_formula`: Formula relating n · P(τ = n) to factorial series  
- `series_reindexing`: Key reindexing lemma connecting to exponential series
- `telescoping_series_identity`: The telescoping property of the PMF
- `exp_series_connection`: Connection to exp(1) = ∑ 1/n!

## Interface

This module provides the analytical machinery needed for the main theorem proof.
The results here bridge between the probability foundations and the final calculation.

/-- Helper lemma: For n ≥ 2, n * hitting_time_pmf n = 1/(n-2)! -/
lemma hitting_time_formula (n : ℕ) (hn : 2 ≤ n) : 
  (n : ℝ) * hitting_time_pmf n = 1 / (n - 2).factorial := by
  -- This is the key formula that connects our expectation to the factorial series
  -- n * ((n-1)/n!) = (n*(n-1))/n! = (n*(n-1))/(n*(n-1)*(n-2)!) = 1/(n-2)!
  rw [pmf_eq n hn]

  -- The algebraic manipulation follows from factorial properties
  -- n * (n-1) / n! = 1 / (n-2)! after cancellation
  sorry

/-- Helper lemma: For n < 2, n * hitting_time_pmf n = 0 -/
lemma hitting_time_zero (n : ℕ) (hn : n < 2) : 
  (n : ℝ) * hitting_time_pmf n = 0 := by
  -- Since P(τ = n) = 0 for n < 2, the product is zero
  cases n with
  | zero =>
    -- n = 0: 0 * P(τ = 0) = 0
    simp [hitting_time_pmf]

    cases n' with
    | zero =>

/-- The hitting time expectation series is summable -/
theorem hitting_time_series_summable :
  Summable (fun n : ℕ => (n : ℝ) * hitting_time_pmf n) := by
  -- Strategy: Use the formula n * hitting_time_pmf n = 1/(n-2)! for n ≥ 2
  -- and show this is essentially the factorial series with index shift
  -- The first two terms are zero, so we can use summable_nat_add_iff
  
  rw [← summable_nat_add_iff 2]
  -- Now we need to show (fun n => (n+2) * hitting_time_pmf (n+2)) is summable
  -- By hitting_time_formula, this equals (fun n => 1/n!)

## Section 2: Series Reindexing and Telescoping

/-- Key reindexing lemma: The expectation series equals the factorial series -/
lemma series_reindexing : 
  ∑' n : ℕ, (n : ℝ) * hitting_time_pmf n = ∑' n : ℕ, (1 : ℝ) / n.factorial := by
  -- This is the heart of the proof: our expectation series is exactly ∑ 1/n!
  -- The proof uses the reindexing established in hitting_time_series_summable
  
  -- Split the sum based on n < 2 vs n ≥ 2
  have h_split : ∑' n : ℕ, (n : ℝ) * hitting_time_pmf n = 
                 ∑' n : ℕ, (n : ℝ) * hitting_time_pmf (n + 2) := by
    -- The transformation: remove the first two zero terms and shift index
    -- Since n * hitting_time_pmf n = 0 for n < 2, we can reindex
    sorry
  
  rw [h_split]
  -- The reindexing shows this equals the factorial series
  -- Each term (n+2) * hitting_time_pmf (n+2) = 1/n! by hitting_time_formula
  -- But we need to be careful about the indexing mismatch
  sorry

/-- Connection to exponential series -/
lemma exp_series_connection : 
  ∑' n : ℕ, (1 : ℝ) / n.factorial = exp 1 := by
  -- This is the fundamental series representation of e
  -- exp(x) = ∑ x^n/n!, so exp(1) = ∑ 1/n!

## Section 3: Telescoping Series Properties

/-- The telescoping identity for partial sums -/
lemma telescoping_partial_sum (N : ℕ) :
  ∑ n ∈ Finset.range N, hitting_time_pmf (n + 2) = 
  1 - 1 / (N + 1).factorial := by
  -- The telescoping property: each PMF term can be written as a difference
  -- P(τ = n) = 1/(n-1)! - 1/n! for n ≥ 2
  -- So the partial sum telescopes to 1 - 1/(N+1)!
  
  -- Use the telescoping identity from ProbabilityFoundations
  have h_telescope : ∀ n ≥ 2, hitting_time_pmf n = 1/(n-1).factorial - 1/n.factorial :=
    pmf_telescoping
  
  -- Apply the telescoping identity to show the finite sum telescopes
  sorry

/-- The telescoping property implies PMF sums to 1 -/
theorem telescoping_pmf_sum : 
  ∑' n : ℕ, hitting_time_pmf n = 1 := by
  -- This follows from the telescoping partial sum taking limit N → ∞
  -- As N → ∞, 1/(N+1)! → 0, so the sum approaches 1
  
  -- Use the decomposition: sum = first two terms + tail sum
  have h_split : ∑' n : ℕ, hitting_time_pmf n = 
                 hitting_time_pmf 0 + hitting_time_pmf 1 + 
                 ∑' n : ℕ, hitting_time_pmf (n + 2) := by
    -- Split the sum into first two terms plus the tail
    sorry
  
  rw [h_split]
  -- First two terms are zero
  have h_zeros := prob_tau_eq_zero_one
  rw [h_zeros.1, h_zeros.2, zero_add, zero_add]
  
  -- Now use telescoping limit
  -- Use the telescoping limit property to show sum equals 1
  sorry

/-- The fundamental series identity underlying the main theorem -/
theorem main_series_identity :
  ∑' n : ℕ, (n : ℝ) * hitting_time_pmf n = exp 1 := by
  -- Combine all the pieces: reindexing + exponential series connection
  calc ∑' n : ℕ, (n : ℝ) * hitting_time_pmf n
      = ∑' n : ℕ, (1 : ℝ) / n.factorial := series_reindexing
